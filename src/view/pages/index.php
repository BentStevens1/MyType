    <p class= "body__text anim-1 gs_reveal">It was a cold morning in the year 1692. I was born in a small village named <span class= "highlight">Cradley, Worcestershire </span>. I had a hard working family and from early on I was trained to be an engraver. Engraving is one of the oldest and most important techniques when producing images on paper in artistic printmaking. It was a simple life. Around the age of seventeen, I became an apprentice to a local <span class= "highlight">engraver of gunlocks and barrels</span>. That's where I started to learn all about the ins and out of metalwork.</p>

      <p class= "body__text body__text-padding anim-2 gs_reveal">In <span class= "highlight">1716</span> I started a business in London. I was an official engraver of gun locks and barrels, and made tools for bookbinders. Metalwork is a form of art in my opinion, it requires precision and patience.</p>
      <p class= "body__text body__text-padding anim-2 gs_reveal">For seven years I did numerous assignments for many different people. My metal craftsmanship was noticed by <span class= "highlight">the printer John Watts</span>. He gave me the task of cutting type punches for various presses in London. I challenged myself and took the job.</p>
      <p class= "body__text body__text-padding anim-2 gs_reveal">It's from that moment that I became more and more interested in the <span class= "highlight">art of letter engraving</span>.</p>

In the years that followed, I took on countless of other jobs for companies that had to do with letter engraving.

    <p class= "body__text-center body__text-padding">The typeface is now <span class= "highlight">used in psalter and the New Testament</span>. William saw the passion in me and we became good friends. Through jobs like this, the word spread about my type engraving.</p>

    <p class= "body__text success__text anim-1 gs_reveal">Sure there where challenges, moments of doubt and setbacks. But from 1720 to 1780 few books were printed in England that did not use type from my foundry. Yes, I made a lot of typefaces in my years as a type founder. Still I felt a <span class= "highlight">burning desire</span> to keep moving. Why did I leave my simple life and home town?

A new roman typeface with lots of character. It was first used in 1726 and a few years later it came to be called Caslon. Named after me of course.</p>
      <p class= "specimen__text body__text-padding">I issued my first official specimen sheet of the typeface in 1734 and exhibited the roman and italic types in 14 different sizes. The Caslon typeface eventually spread <span class= "highlight">all over Europe and the American colonies</span>. It became so popular that the expression “When in doubt, use Caslon” came about. I am really proud of that. </p>

  <p class= "characteristics__text anim-3 gs_reveal">The Caslon typeface is extremely <span class= "highlight">legible, yet graceful and classic</span>. That is why a lot of printers like to use it for printed communication pieces. I designed the typeface with the <span class= "highlight">Old-style typeface</span> characteristics in mind.
